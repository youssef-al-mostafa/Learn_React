# Learn React - A Step-by-Step Journey

Welcome to my "Learn React" repository! This project documents my journey learning React.js, with each commit representing a specific concept, pattern, or best practice. By navigating through the commit history, you can follow along with my learning path and see how code evolves as new React concepts are incorporated.

## üöÄ Purpose

This repository serves as both a personal learning tool and a resource for others learning React. Each commit focuses on a single concept with detailed messages explaining:

- What was learned
- Code changes made
- Why the approach works
- Common pitfalls to avoid

## üìã How to Use This Repository

### For Learners

1. **Browse Commit History**: Browse Commit History: The commit history is organized from basic to advanced concepts, with each commit representing a single concept or lesson. This learning path progresses from easier fundamentals to more complex advanced React patterns.
   
2. **Checkout Specific Lessons**: Use `git checkout <commit-hash>` to view the codebase at a specific learning stage.
   
3. **Compare Changes**: Use `git diff <previous-commit>..<current-commit>` to see exactly what changed between lessons.

4. **Read Lesson Notes**: Each commit in this repository is accompanied by a `LESSON_NOTES.md` file that summarizes the concept being taught in that commit. These notes include:
- Clear explanation of the concept
- Key points to remember
- Further resources

## Who This Repository Is For

This repository is designed for intermediate-level React developers who already understand the basics. It assumes you're familiar with:

JavaScript fundamentals and ES6+ features
Basic React concepts (components, props, state)
React project setup and tooling

The commits and examples focus on intermediate to advanced patterns, optimizations, and best practices rather than teaching React from scratch. If you're completely new to React, I recommend first familiarizing yourself with the basics through the React official documentation before diving into this repository.

## üîç Current Progress

Check the latest commits to see which concepts have been covered so far. The repository will be continuously updated as I progress through different React topics.

## üí° Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, suggestions for improvements or corrections are welcome! Feel free to:

1. Open an issue to suggest a topic
2. Submit a pull request to fix or improve explanations
3. Ask questions in the issues section
